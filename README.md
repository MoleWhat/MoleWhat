### Introduction
The following project intends to provide a basic game in which chemistry students can study, memorize and learn the molecules names and their descriptions according to the [International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry](https://iupac.org/).

The need for such a project stems as a desire to help students challenge their knowledge of chemistry, specifically molecules names, through a game that puts their memorization skills to work. There is currently no game that allows you to do this. Studying and memorizing important things is intended to be fun and challenging through the levels that this game offers.

### Objectives
The expected output of this project is to be a software that potential users can download on their own devices and start playing. It will save the personal information of the user locally, not in the cloud.

### About documentation

It is not necessary to have advanced computer knowledge, however, it is recommended to know how to use the terminal of your device to run the program by following the steps that we will provide later. Prior knowledge of molecule names is recommended if you want to use it as a knowledge test, however it can also be played for the purpose of learning from scratch. This is the first version of the game, so don't get surprised if there are not many levels yet.

### Toolset - Operational concepts

#### Installation
This program does not require installation. However, it does require the following dependencies installed on the system:
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) | v 3.10.4
* [Guizero](https://pypi.org/project/guizero/) | v 1.3.0 
* [Sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/es/3/library/sqlite3.html) | v. 3.36.0
* [drkit](https://www.rdkit.org/)
* [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/es/3/library/tkinter.html) | v. 8.6
* [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)

Run your executable to get started as quickly as possible by doing the following:
* Unzip the folder.
* Open the folders.
* Allow execute, read and write permissions.

#### Uninstallation
Simply remove the directory, and if possible, remove dependencies as well.

#### Usage
No login required. The player's progress is saved locally in the database.

### Shortcuts and commands

### Error messages and Troubleshooting
First, try running the executable from a terminal so you can see all the output. Remember to remove the -w build flag to see all the stdout in a console window. Often, you’ll see ImportError exceptions if a dependency is missing.

### Glosary
